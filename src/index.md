**Welcome to my #100DaysOfCode project website.**

> NOTE: This site will be in constant flux and changing during the 100 days of this project.
> [Clone this project and make your own site!](https://github.com/shanerobinson/sr-100daysofcode)

I created this mostly as an exercise in daily documentation and social interaction. The project management part is generally easy as we've been managing clients and projects in our company, [Bare Feet Studios, LLC](https://www.barefeetstudios.com) since 1996.

## What this project/site is:

- A playground for me to experiment and extend my knowledge and experience building static sites in [11ty](https://11ty.dev) and using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com).
- A place to document what I do and learn during the [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/).
- A site to serve as reference for future projects.
- An exercise in "getting back into social media" after dropping out several years ago out of frustration with what social media has become.

**[Please subscribe](https://shanerobinson.ck.page/100daysofcode) if you would like to follow along with weekly email udpates on the progress.**

## What this site IS NOT:

- A tutorial site with step-by-step instructions.

> IF you are new to static site generators like **11ty**, or you are like me and began programming in high school in 1983, and spent the last 22+ years working professionally with a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, mySQL, PHP) and are wondering what all this [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/) stuff is, <a href="mailto:info@barefeetstudios">drop me an email</a> and I would be happy to consult with you and provide step-by-step instructions on how to get started and host blazingly fast and secure sites for free.

Here's the original #100DaysOfCode project video:

## Extra...

Oh... And I'm also doing [#100DaysOfArt on my Instagram](https://instagram.com/shanerobinson) if you're interested in how an Artist & Programmer merges those two seemingly disparate worlds...
