**Welcome to my #100DaysOfCode project website.**

> NOTE: **This is NOT the finished website.** Continue reading for details on why it exists in this current state.

I created this mostly as an exercise in project management, documentation, and social interaction. The project management part is generally easy as we've been managing clients and projects in our company, [Bare Feet Studios, LLC](https://www.barefeetstudios.com) since 1996.

But for me, the documentation and social interaction parts are difficult as I prefer to exist behind the scenes and write the code that makes everything work.

So I'm using my new found interest in static sites, *(specifically [11ty](https://11ty.dev))* and migrating existing Wordpress sites *(which are complicated, painfully slow, bloated, and insecure)* to 11ty as an excuse to take on the [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) project.

This website, built with 11ty, and hosted on [Netlify](https://Netlify.com) will also evolve during the project.

### Day 001

Today, **Day 001**, was about:

- setting up the project management, which I did in [Notion](https://notion.so) *(which I may also make public during this project...another good reason to subscribe :wink: )*,
- creating this project website and pushing it to Netlify for FREE hosting,
- creating the [ConvertKit subscription landing page](https://shanerobinson.ck.page/100daysofcode) in case you'd like to subscribe to weekly updates on my progress,
- and Tweeting about my project per the [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/rules/) 'rules.'

### Extra...

Oh... And I'm also doing [#100DaysOfArt on my Instagram](https://instagram.com/shanerobinson) if you're interested in how an Artist & Programmer merges those two seemingly disparate worlds...
