Shane Robinson is a programmer, maker, and artist. He received his B.F.A. in Ceramics, Sculpture, and Drawing from the University of Iowa School of Art and Art History.

In high school he taught himself to program in [B.A.S.I.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) on his [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64) and helped teach the high school computer classes using [Apple II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II_series). 

He was a professional potter and furniture maker/designer for a few years after graduating from UofI. A friend's [Mac Centris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Centris) reignighted his interests in computers and he once again taught himself HTML, SQL, etc. and went on to found [one of the first web/database development firms in the Southwest](https://web.archive.org/web/19970714183733/http://www.otakusymtezzi.com/). That firm grew into the present day [Bare Feet Studios, LLC](https://www.barefeetstudios.com) in which he is a partner with [Roxanne Darling](https://roxannedarling.com/).

Currently semi-retired, the world of [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), and static sites like [11ty](https://11ty.dev) have pulled him back in to active production.
