It's Friday and it's a shortcode day!

There is a great [11ty YouTube embed plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eleventy-plugin-youtube-embed) but it has limitations. The most important being that there is no **"title"** attribute on the YouTube iFrame tag.

That **"title"** attribute is very [important for accessibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe#Accessibility_concern) and your site will also get dinged by [Lighthouse performance tests](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) if your iFrames don't have that **"title"** attribute.

So I completely removed the YouTube plugin and wrote my own **YouTube shortcode** that requires you provide a Title...and optionally lets you set the video start time.

## Code Updates

`/utils/shortcodes.js`

```js
/**
 * My own YouTube embed
 * instead of the plugin that wasn't configurable and didn't have Title
 * slug = required
 * title = required
 * startTime = optional
 */
youtube: function (slug, title, startTime) {
  return `<div id="${slug}" class="relative w-full video-16x9"><iframe class="absolute top-0 bottom-0 left-0 right-0 w-full h-full" width="100%" height="100%" title="${title}" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/${slug}${
    startTime ? `?start=${startTime}` : ''
  }" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen loading="lazy"></iframe></div>`
},
```

[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) makes it easy to manage responsive elements (videos, images, etc.) but video embeds do require a custom CSS class in order to get the correct height for the videos.

You'll see in the shortcode above a custom CSS class, `video-16x9` which was added to the `tailwind.css` file in order to set the correct height of the video embed:

`/src/assets/css/tailwind.css`

```css
/* For video embeds shortcode
    9 / 16 = .5625 * 100 = 56.25% */
.video-16x9 {
	padding-bottom: 56.25%;
}
```

## Shortcode Usage

In order to use it, you just copy the YouTube video ID and use it as the first value in the shortcode. The second value is the title.

Here's an example using my video from 2013 where I demo my design and build for a **Gallery Wall System**.

```html
{%raw%} {% youtube "uJ-yFkJ9ykA", "Shane Robinson - Gallery Wall System" %}
{%endraw%}
```

{% youtube "uJ-yFkJ9ykA", "Shane Robinson - Gallery Wall System" %}
