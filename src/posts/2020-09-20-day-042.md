Well... It's been a while since I posted an update on my #100DaysOfCode website. Lots happening in these past 2+ weeks. But in terms of this #100DaysOfCode project, the most important update is that I officially launched my [11ty](https://11ty.dev "11ty Static Site Generator"), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com "TailwindCSS Utility-First CSS Framework"), [Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine "Alpine.js : Think of it like Tailwind for JavaScript") template system that I call: **[11TA](https://11ta.netlify.app)**

The [11TA Template System](https://11ta.netlify.app "11TA Static Site Template System") demo site actually serves as the feature list and example of how a website would look out of the box with no customization. The [11TA Blog Posts](https://11ta.netlify.app/blog/) each highlight a different feature and its usage. 

Iâ€™m not going to repeat information that's already on the 11TA site. If you're interested in building static sites with one of the most flexible and powerful SSG _(static site generators)_, hope over to my [11TA Template System](https://11ta.netlify.app "11TA Static Site Template System") and read the feature list and installation instructions on the home page and check out the blog.
