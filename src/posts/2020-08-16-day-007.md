Sunday Cheat Day... And I had not yet publicly announced that a couple weeks ago I built a little [11ty](https://11ty.dev '11ty Static Site Generator') and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com 'TailwindCSS Utility-First CSS Framework') application that is a replacement for [Linktr.ee](https://linktr.ee) and [Linkin.bio](https://linkin.bio).

I call it ["Linkist" (detailed instructions here)](https://github.com/shanerobinson/linkist) and you can clone it, make your own version, and host for free at [Netlify](https://netlify.com 'Netflify - Server Less, Do More')!
