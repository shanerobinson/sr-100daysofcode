Today wasn't so much about exploring new stuff for #100DaysOfCode. The time was spent updating [a site I rebuilt 3+ years ago](https://www.lannan.org) in [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

This client has been with us since 1998...22+ years as of this post. And we built their first site in just PHP. We then migrated to [ExpressionEngine](https://expressionengine.com/) when it was still called "pMachine."

We saw lots of problems in the ExpressionEngine company and community and were lucky to get the site migrated to Craft prior to what became a confusing mess at ExpressionEngine. 

Craft is brilliant, elegant, and a joy to develop. Bootstrap...not so much. But several years ago Bootstrap was the 500 lb gorilla and everyone was using it. 

Oh how I wish I had known about [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com "TailwindCSS Utility-First CSS Framework") back then. Today would have been a much more pleasant experience dealing with the CSS updates. 

A few months after we launched this client's site, Craft updated to version 3...which was a rewrite from the ground up. We couldn't just turn around and rebuild the site in Craft 3 so we've been patiently waiting for Craft 4. Once that drops and is stable, we'll refactor the site for Craft 4 and I'll definitely take advantage of that project to dump Bootstrap and rebuild with Tailwind!
