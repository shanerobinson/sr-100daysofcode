I spent the time today stripping out all the [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com "TailwindCSS Utility-First CSS Framework") customizations from the `tailwind.config.js` file for one of my internal [11ty](https://11ty.dev "11ty Static Site Generator") projects. 

From the [TailwindCSS Typography plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin#app) docs:

> The @tailwindcss/typography plugin adds a set of customizable prose classes that you can use to add beautiful typographic defaults to any vanilla HTML, like the output you'd get after parsing some Markdown, or content you pull from a CMS.

But... It also adds ~75kb to the basic CSS file...which in my case is only ~14kb to start. And while I'm not terribly concerned with the extra ~75kb, the biggest problem is what it does to add *"beautiful typographic defaults..."*. In order to do this it completely borks default margins, paddings, links, etc. 

In my experience using the Typographic plugin, it takes more work to configure elements to NOT USE the "prose" classes and re-establish margins and paddings. 

All that being said, I'm still using it on this site because this site IS extremely simple and basic in its use of layout elements and TailwindCSS. But for the internal project from which I stripped the plugin and classes, it was getting in the way.
