Continuing with the Coda.io work from [Day 022](/day-022-codaio-api-and-postman/).

I polished up and shared an example Doc I made showing how to create and manage reusable components.

While I still enjoy working with Notion.so, and we use it for project management and as a knowledge base and personal/company wiki, Coda.io has far more features and functionality.

If you already have a Coda.io account, you can copy and play with my shared doc below:
