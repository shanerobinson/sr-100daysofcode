In addition to working on personal projects today, I also spent a bit of time playing with [n8n](https://n8n.io/ 'Extendable workflow automation tool').

![n8n](/assets/images/008/n8n.jpg)

n8n is an open source, extendable workflow automation tool. Think of [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) and [Integromat](https://www.integromat.com/) and [Parabola](https://parabola.io/) except FREE and you host it locally!

It's limited in what it can currently do in terms of Triggers compared to Zapier, Integromat, or Parabola. For example, it currently doesnâ€™t have triggers for [Todoist](https://todoist.com/ 'Organize it all with Todoist') or [Coda](https://coda.io/ 'Coda is a new doc for teams') which are two of my core apps.

Because it currently doesn't have "triggers" for Todoist or Coda, you can't use it to watch Todoist for when you create a new Task in a specific Project and automatically create a new row in a specific Coda table.

But the open source community is constantly improving n8n. I know because I've been "watching" the [n8n project on GitHub](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n 'n8n on Github') and it's one of the most active repos I watch!
