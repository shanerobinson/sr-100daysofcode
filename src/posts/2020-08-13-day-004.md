Worked on [Lighthouse Performance](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) scores today and still have some improvements to make.

## Scores

## Remaining Performance Items

- Figure out how to use external fonts without getting dinged for "render-blocking-resources".
  - Iâ€™m already using "preconnect" but it's still an issue for the "Inter" font I'm using.
  - I inlined the PrismJS syntax highlighting code.
  - The TailwindCSS and TailwindUI generates about 88kb of css... and I don't want to inline that...yet.
  - And Tailwind's use of PurgeCSS doesn't seem to purge the unused TailwindUI elements.
  - **Seriously considering dropping TailwindUI due to the extra weight it brings.**
