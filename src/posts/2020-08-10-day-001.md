Today was about:

- [x] setting up the project management, which I did in [Notion](https://notion.so) *(which I may also make public during this project...another good reason to subscribe :wink: )*,
- [x] creating this project website and pushing it to Netlify for FREE hosting,
- [x] creating the [ConvertKit subscription landing page](https://shanerobinson.ck.page/100daysofcode) in case you'd like to subscribe to weekly updates on my progress,
- [x] and Tweeting about my project per the [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/rules/) 'rules.'
