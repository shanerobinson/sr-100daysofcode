Took a break today to watch several tutorials that have been piling up in my [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) lists. 

This one from [Learn with Jason : Create a Plugin for 11ty](https://www.learnwithjason.dev/create-a-plugin-for-11ty) with [Bryan Robinson](https://twitter.com/brob) *(no relation...that I know of)* was very helpful. AND basically I learned that my YouTube embed shortcut IS an [11ty](https://11ty.dev) plugin if I were to just package it up. 

This post from Bryan, [Creating an 11ty Plugin - SVG Embed Tool](https://bryanlrobinson.com/blog/creating-11ty-plugin-embed-svg-contents/) was also very helpful!
