Main task for today was to add META, open graph, and Twitter card support to both the `base.njk` file and the Frontmatter of the daily posts. Not difficult... And helps when when the content is shared. 

Also created a template for the daily post markdown file because the frontmatter is getting longer and I don't want to have to copy/paste from previous days.
